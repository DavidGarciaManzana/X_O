In a world where letters roamed freely, there lived a powerful warrior named XO. XO was tasked with a crucial mission - to ensure that all strings in the land had an equal balance of the letters 'x' and 'o'.

One day, a young and ambitious warrior came to XO with a challenge. The warrior wanted to create a technique that would determine if a given string was in balance, meaning it had the same number of 'x's and 'o's. The technique must return a boolean value and should not be influenced by the case of the letters. The string could contain any letter.

Your job is to help XO find the solution and determine if each string is in balance. With your help, XO will be able to conquer this challenge and keep the kingdom of letters in balance.
